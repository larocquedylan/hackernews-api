① Define What "Trending" Means
First, clearly define metrics for trending:

Stories that rapidly climb in points.

Stories with many comments in a short span.

Stories frequently appearing or referenced repeatedly.

② Identify Data Sources
We have two primary ways to scrape Hacker News:

Option A: Hacker News API (Recommended)

Use the official API: https://github.com/HackerNews/API.

Fetch /topstories.json, /newstories.json, and individual story items.

Regularly poll endpoints to track changes (points, comments).

Pros: Easy, fast, officially supported.
Cons: Polling required; no real-time notifications.

Option B: Direct HTML Scraping

Fetch HTML directly from https://news.ycombinator.com/.

Use libraries like Cheerio or Puppeteer to parse HTML.

Extract title, score, comments, timestamps.

Pros: Can grab additional data like rank or positioning easily.
Cons: Fragile (depends on HN’s HTML structure), more brittle, likely slower.

I recommend starting with Option A (API).

③ Data Collection Strategy
Set up automated polling:

Run a cron job or scheduled script every ~5-10 minutes.

Store snapshots of story IDs, titles, points, comments, and timestamps in a simple database (e.g., SQLite, JSON file, PostgreSQL).

Example schema:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"id": 43514383,
"title": "OpenAI launches GPT-5",
"url": "https://openai.com/gpt-5",
"score": 123,
"comments": 47,
"timestamp": "2025-03-29T12:05:00Z"
}
④ Trend Detection Logic
Trending topics typically exhibit:

Rapid increase in scores or comments.

Multiple appearances in short time.

High "velocity": points/comments per minute since first observed.

Example trending logic:

Calculate growth rate (current_score - initial_score) / minutes_since_first_seen.

Rank stories by their growth rate (top N are trending).

Flag stories that consistently rank highly over multiple intervals.

⑤ Displaying Results
Simple webpage showing live-updating list of trending stories.

Visualize "velocity," "comments," and "points."

Optional notification system (Slack, email, or webhook) for rapid-trend alerts.

⑥ Advanced Extensions (Optional)
Sentiment analysis of comments to gauge discussion tone.

Keyword extraction to cluster similar trending topics.

Historical analysis to predict future trending stories.

Recommended Starting Approach (Simplest MVP):
Use HN API to regularly pull data.

Store snapshots in a lightweight local database.

Calculate basic growth metrics.

Expose a simple web interface displaying trending stories.

This is your quickest route to a functioning trending topic scraper.
